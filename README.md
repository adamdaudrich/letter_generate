# letter_generate
Automated generation of 200+ grant request letters for a charity organization. 
The idea here was to expedite the process of filling addresses, which was previously done one-by-one.
I used Google Sheets to field address and contact information.
Letters were "cleaned" for correct spacing and case-sensitivity.
The "Fillable document" plugin was used to automatically generate final .docx files ready for printing.
I have included one sample letter.
